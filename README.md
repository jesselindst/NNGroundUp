# Neural Network from Scratch for Image Classification

This project implements a simple feedforward neural network from scratch using NumPy for classifying images. I know my implementation sucks. Rewrite coming soon. Might implement some optimizers and actually run it fast on Cuda but till than have fun with slow code. But hey, it learns.

## TODO

- [ ] Implement optimizers
- [ ] Implement Cuda
- [ ] Implement Grid Search
- [ ] Implement Cross Validation
